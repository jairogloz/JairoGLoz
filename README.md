👋 Hello there! I’m a Backend Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience crafting scalable systems, specializing in Go (my favorite 🚀), but I’m also comfortable working with Python, Java, and JavaScript. I love tackling complex problems, breaking them into manageable pieces, and turning them into robust solutions.

🎯 What I do:
- Build backend systems with a focus on clean architecture (hello, Hexagonal Architecture!) and maintainable code.
- Design efficient databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Neo4j are my go-to tools.
- Explore the future: Recently, I’ve been creating APIs that integrate AI with OpenAI models.

👨‍💻 My values:
- Clear code is kind code. I document extensively, use meaningful naming conventions, and ensure my future self (and others) can navigate my code effortlessly.
- Team player. Whether mentoring juniors, gathering client requirements, or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I believe great products come from great teamwork.
- Always learning. From building payment orchestration systems to exploring AR/VR and AI, I’m always up for a challenge.

🌟 Let’s connect! I’m here to share ideas, build awesome projects, and keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
